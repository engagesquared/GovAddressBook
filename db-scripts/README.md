3. FavoriteInternal - junction table for UserProfileInternal (many-to-many).
4. FavoriteExternal - junction table for UserProfileInternal and UserProfileExternal (many-to-many).
5. PartnerIncomingConnection - stores API Keys and URL Endpoints for other partners/tenants to read user profiles from current tenant.
6. PartnerOutgoingConnection - stores API Keys and URL Endpoints for current tenant to read user profiles from other partners.
