# Introduction

An External Web App which will be used by other organisations to connect to current tenantâ€™s directory in order to search its user database.  

To connect to another organisation, admins will need an API Key from that organisation, as well as their IP Address/API Endpoint URL. Admins can generate API keys and white label IP addresses (using firewall rules), as well as administer their connections to other Hosts using the Admin UI. 

This App Service will perform actions: 
1. Search users in current tenant for other partners/tenant to read (External Index Search Service) 
2. Get user profile for users in other partners/tenants
